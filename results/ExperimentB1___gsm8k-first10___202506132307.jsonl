{"premise": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?", "reasoning": "Let 'c' be the number of clips Natalia sold in April. Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, so c = 48.\nNatalia sold half as many clips in May, so the number of clips sold in May is (48 / 2) = 24.\nThe total number of clips sold in April and May is c + 24 = 48 + 24 = 72.\nTherefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.", "true_answer": "Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72"}
{"premise": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting.
