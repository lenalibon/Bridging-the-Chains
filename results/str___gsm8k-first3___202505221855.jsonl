{"premise": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the number of eggs Janet lays each day. 16 eggs/day * 3 days/morning = 48 eggs.", "true_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"}
{"premise": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?", "reasoning": "First, determine the amount of blue fiber. A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Blue fiber is 2 bolts.", "true_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"}
{"premise": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the original value of the house.\nThen, calculate the increase in value.\nFinally, subtract the cost of repairs from the increase to find the profit.", "true_answer": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000"}
