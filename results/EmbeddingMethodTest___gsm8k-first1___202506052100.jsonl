{"premise": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", "reasoning": "First, find the number of eggs Janet lays per day. It is given as 16 eggs/day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes muffins for her friends with 4. So, the number of eggs remaining is 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs.\nNext, determine the daily revenue from selling the remaining eggs. She sells each egg for $2, and she has 9 eggs. Therefore, her daily revenue is 9 * $2 = $18.", "true_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"}
