{"premise": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?", "reasoning": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April.\nShe sold half as many clips in May, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May.\nThe total number of clips sold in April and May is 48 + 24 = 72.\nSo, the answer is 72.", "true_answer": "Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72"}
{"premise": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?", "reasoning": "Convert the babysitting time to minutes: 50 minutes * 60 minutes/hour = 3000 minutes.\nCalculate the total earnings: $12/hour * 3000 minutes = $36000.\nTherefore, Weng earned $36000.", "true_answer": "Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.\n#### 10"}
