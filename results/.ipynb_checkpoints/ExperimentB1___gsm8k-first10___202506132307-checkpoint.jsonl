{"premise": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?", "reasoning": "Let 'c' be the number of clips Natalia sold in April. Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, so c = 48.\nNatalia sold half as many clips in May, so the number of clips sold in May is (48 / 2) = 24.\nThe total number of clips sold in April and May is c + 24 = 48 + 24 = 72.\nTherefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.", "true_answer": "Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72"}
{"premise": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?", "reasoning": "First, convert the babysitting time to minutes: 50 minutes * 60 minutes/hour = 3000 minutes.\nNext, calculate the earnings: $12/hour * 3000 minutes = $36000.\nTherefore, Weng earned $36000.", "true_answer": "Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.\n#### 10"}
{"premise": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?", "reasoning": "First, find the amount Betty has: $15 / 2 = $7.50.\nNext, find the amount her parents gave her: $15.\nThen, find the amount her grandparents gave her: $15 * 2 = $30.\nFinally, add the amounts: $7.50 + $15 + $30 = $52.50.\nSo, Betty needs $52.50 more.", "true_answer": "In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.\nBetty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.\nThis means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more.\n#### 5"}
