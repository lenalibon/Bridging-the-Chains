{"premise": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the number of eggs Janet lays every day.", "true_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"}
{"premise": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?", "reasoning": "First, find the amount of white fiber needed.", "true_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"}
{"premise": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the increase in value of the house.\nThen, calculate the profit.", "true_answer": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000"}
{"premise": "James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?", "reasoning": "First, find the total distance James runs in one week.\nThen, multiply the total distance by the number of times he runs in a week.", "true_answer": "He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times\nSo he runs 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 meters\n#### 540"}
{"premise": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives her flock each day.", "true_answer": "If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.\nIf she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.\n#### 20"}
