{"premise": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the number of clips sold in April: 48 clips / 2 = 24 clips.\nNext, calculate the number of clips sold in May: 24 clips / 2 = 12 clips.\nFinally, add the number of clips sold in April and May: 24 clips + 12 clips = 36 clips.\nTherefore, Natalia sold 36 clips altogether.", "true_answer": "Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72"}
{"premise": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?", "reasoning": "First, convert 50 minutes to hours: 50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5/6 hours.", "true_answer": "Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.\n#### 10"}
{"premise": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?", "reasoning": "Start with the total cost of the wallet: $100.\nBetty has half of the money she needs: $100 / 2 = $50.\nHer parents give her $15: $50 + $15 = $65.\nHer grandparents give her twice as much as her parents: $15 * 2 = $30.\nTotal amount Betty has: $65 + $30 = $95.\nBetty needs $100 - $95 = $5 more.", "true_answer": "In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.\nBetty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.\nThis means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more.\n#### 5"}
{"premise": "Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?", "reasoning": "Julie has 120 pages in the book.", "true_answer": "Maila read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.\nSo she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages since yesterday.\nThere are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to be read.\nSince she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.\n#### 42"}
