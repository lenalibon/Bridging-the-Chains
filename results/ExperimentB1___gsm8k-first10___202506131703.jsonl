{"premise": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?", "reasoning": "Let 'c' be the number of clips Natalia sold in April.\nLet 'c/2' be the number of clips Natalia sold in May.", "true_answer": "Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72"}
{"premise": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?", "reasoning": "Convert 50 minutes to hours: 50 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5/6 hours.", "true_answer": "Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.\n#### 10"}
{"premise": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?", "reasoning": "First, determine the amount Betty has: half of $100 = $50.", "true_answer": "In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.\nBetty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.\nThis means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more.\n#### 5"}
{"premise": "Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday.

{"premise": "James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?", "reasoning": "James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.", "true_answer": "He writes each friend 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 pages a week\nSo he writes 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 pages every week\nThat means he writes 12*52=<<12*52=624>>624 pages a year\n#### 624"}
{"premise": "Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the number of purple flowers.", "true_answer": "There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nSo in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.\nPurple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.\nThat means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.\nSo in total Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 plants in his garden.\n#### 35"}
