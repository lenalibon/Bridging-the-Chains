{"premise": "Arnel had ten boxes of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box.  He kept ten pencils and shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. If his friends got eight pencils each, how many pencils are in each box?", "reasoning": "First, calculate the total number of pencils Arnel had: 10 boxes * 10 pencils/box = 100 pencils\nNext, calculate the number of pencils Arnel shared with his friends: 5 friends * 8 pencils/friend = 40 pencils\nThen, calculate the number of pencils remaining: 100 pencils - 40 pencils = 60 pencils\nFinally, divide the remaining pencils equally among the boxes: 60 pencils / 10 boxes = 6 pencils/box\nSo, each box contains 6 pencils", "true_answer": "Arnel shared 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 pencils with his friends.\nSo, he had 10 + 40 = <<10+40=50>>50 pencils in all.\nTherefore, each box had 50/10 = <<50/10=5>>5 pencils inside.\n#### 5"}
